Importance of .gitignore for .env files:
.env files contain sensitive information and should not be committed to version control. Adding .env to .gitignore prevents accidental exposure of credentials.

Risks of exposing credentials:
Exposing credentials can lead to unauthorized access to databases and services, potentially resulting in data breaches or system compromises.
