Subnet and Static IP Range Selection:
- We chose the subnet 172.20.0.0/16 for our custom network.
- Static IPs: 172.20.0.2 (web), 172.20.0.3 (db)

Impact of Overlapping Subnets:
Overlapping subnets can cause routing conflicts and network connectivity issues on the host system.

DNS Resolution in Docker:
Docker provides automatic DNS resolution for container names within the same network, allowing containers to communicate using service names instead of IP addresses.
